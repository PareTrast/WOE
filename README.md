Ever since my mother passed away I have always had problems with anxiety and depression.  This simple random quote generator is a simple 
project I put together to generate some encouraging quotes to help people.  Sometimes the best thing to help during an anxiety attack, or 
in a depressive episode is to have some consoling words.  I may not be able to help the world, but if I can help just a few people then 
I will have fulfilled my goal.

The reason why I chose Words of Encouragement or WOE as the name of my project is because I have found myself helping others out just 
by giving them words of encouragement.  Random people will tell me that I helped them feel better even after a bad day.  I do not see
myself as anything special, but if I can help others out then that will make me feel better.myself

The second reason I chose the name is because WOE is a play on words.  A WOE is defined as a great sorrow or distress.  I want to take that 
negative word and spin it in a positive light.
